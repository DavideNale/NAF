# Instant Neural Acoustic Fields

## Overview

This repository houses my thesis work on Neural Radiance Fields (Nerfs) applied to spatial audio.
This work, inspired by [NAF](https://github.com/aluo-x/Learning_Neural_Acoustic_Fields), aims at providing a realtime system that can be embedded in game engines.
